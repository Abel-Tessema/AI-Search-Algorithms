# Python Project with Docker

This is a simple Python project designed to run inside a Docker container. The provided Dockerfile uses the `python:slim` image to ensure a lightweight and efficient environment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

## Files in This Project

- `Dockerfile`: Contains instructions to build the Docker image.
- `main.py`: The main Python script that runs inside the container.
- Other necessary files/code for the project.

## Build and Run Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

If this project is stored in a version control system (e.g., GitHub), clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Use the following command to build the Docker image:
```bash
$ docker build . -t python-docker-app
```
- `.` specifies the current directory as the build context.
- `-t python-docker-app` tags the image with the name `python-docker-app`.

### 3. Run the Docker Container

Run the container interactively, allowing you to provide inputs via `stdin`:
```bash
$ docker run -it python-docker-app
```

### 4. Verify Output

After running the container, you should see the output of your Python script (`main.py`) and can provide inputs interactively.
